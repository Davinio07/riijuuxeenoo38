# Retrospective sprint 


// Alle tekst met // weghalen voordat je het op DLO zet. Zorg dat het document er verzorgd uitziet.

// De retrospective doe je met je team.


Doe de retrospective m.b.v. een van de manieren op https://www.funretrospectives.com/category/retrospective/

>> Formuleer op basis hiervan concrete verbeterpunten voor de komende sprint

>> Geef elkaar feedback op basis van gedrag in de afgelopen sprint.


| Well | Not Well | New Ideas |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Everyone was easily reachable and responded quickly in the group chat | Sometimes we talk past each other, which makes agreements unclear | At the start of each meeting, give a short summary of what was agreed before |
| We helped each other whenever someone got stuck | Not everyone always takes the same level of initiative to share ideas | At the start of each meeting, give a short summary of who the group is and what was worked on |
| Tasks were divided fairly | Deadlines were not always clearly agreed upon or met | At the end of each meeting, define clear to-do’s with responsible persons |
| There was a positive and respectful atmosphere | Sometimes too many things are discussed at once, which makes it chaotic | Use a fixed agenda and limit the number of topics per meeting |
| Everyone was open to feedback | Sometimes feedback is handled too quickly without proper discussion | Plan checkup moments at the end of each sprint before delivering the work |


## Aandeel teamleden

// Geef per teamlid aan hoeveel storypoints of werk hij/zij deze sprint heeft kunnen realiseren. Vervang hieronder de namen van de teamleden en geef per teamlid het aantal storypoints. De mermaid code genereert vervolgens een pie-chart.

// Geef onder de pie chart een korte toelichting: wat valt op?  Kunnen jullie de verschillen verklaren?

## Feedback voor teamleden

// Geef hieronder zo specifiek mogelijke feedback voor elk teamlid.

#### Personal Reflections  

### Davinio  

During Sprint 1 I worked a lot on preparing the design and planning Sprint 2. Together with my team I made a Figma design that was approved, and we started writing the User Stories that still need approval from our PO. Based on my work in Sprint 1, I also received feedback from my team (see “Feedback for Team Members”).  

**As a TOP I received:**  
“You are always there and show motivation.”  
I am happy that I was able to show this in such a short sprint. I will continue to keep this up in the next sprints.  

**As a TIP I received:**  
“Pay more attention to details in your work, and try to take breaks so you stay sharp.”  
I reflected on this and decided that from the next sprint onward, I will pay more attention to details and avoid working too fast so that I reduce mistakes.

### Zarko  

My development goal is to improve my communication and the sharing of ideas. I notice that I often work efficiently and like to help others, but I sometimes express my own thoughts and suggestions too little.  

**Concretely, in the next sprint I will work on this by:**  
- Sharing at least one idea or suggestion each week during the team meeting.  
- Communicating my updates and progress clearly in our group chat.  
- Asking at the end of each week whether my explanations were clear enough, so I can get feedback.  

**SMART Goal:**  
By the end of this sprint, I want to have actively shared my ideas at least four times in team meetings and received feedback confirming that my communication has become clearer.
