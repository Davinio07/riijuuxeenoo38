// Alle tekst met // weghalen voordat je het op DLO zet. Zorg dat het document er verzorgd uitziet.

// De retrospective doe je met je team.


Doe de retrospective m.b.v. een van de manieren op https://www.funretrospectives.com/category/retrospective/

>> Formuleer op basis hiervan concrete verbeterpunten voor de komende sprint

>> Geef elkaar feedback op basis van gedrag in de afgelopen sprint.


| Well | Not Well | New Ideas |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Everyone was easily reachable and responded quickly in the group chat | Sometimes we talk past each other, which makes agreements unclear | At the start of each meeting, give a short summary of what was agreed before |
| We helped each other whenever someone got stuck | Not everyone always takes the same level of initiative to share ideas | At the start of each meeting, give a short summary of who the group is and what was worked on |
| Tasks were divided fairly | Deadlines were not always clearly agreed upon or met | At the end of each meeting, define clear to-do’s with responsible persons |
| There was a positive and respectful atmosphere | Sometimes too many things are discussed at once, which makes it chaotic | Use a fixed agenda and limit the number of topics per meeting |
| Everyone was open to feedback | Sometimes feedback is handled too quickly without proper discussion | Plan checkup moments at the end of each sprint before delivering the work |

#### Personal Reflections  

### Baran

During Sprint 1 I took an active role in the team when it came to discussing the project and and how we would make our designs.  

**As a TOP I received:**
“You bring positive energy, you are a real go-getter.”
I am glad this was noticed, because I think keeping momentum and motivation high is important for the whole team. I will continue to focus on keeping the team motivated and contributing actively.

**As a TIP I received:**
“Keep a closer eye on your planning, and try to ask for feedback from the team more often.”
I recognize this and I want to improve on it. For the next sprint, I will pay more attention to sticking to the planning and regularly ask the team for feedback on my work so I can adjust earlier if needed.

### Davinio  

During Sprint 1 I worked a lot on preparing the design and planning Sprint 2. Together with my team I made a Figma design that was approved, and we started writing the User Stories that still need approval from our PO. Based on my work in Sprint 1, I also received feedback from my team (see “Feedback for Team Members”).  

**As a TOP I received:**  
“You are always there and show motivation.”  
I am happy that I was able to show this in such a short sprint. I will continue to keep this up in the next sprints.  

**As a TIP I received:**  
“Pay more attention to details in your work, and try to take breaks so you stay sharp.”  
I reflected on this and decided that from the next sprint onward, I will pay more attention to details and avoid working too fast so that I reduce mistakes.

### Zarko  

My development goal is to improve my communication and the sharing of ideas. I notice that I often work efficiently and like to help others, but I sometimes express my own thoughts and suggestions too little.  

**Concretely, in the next sprint I will work on this by:**  
- Sharing at least one idea or suggestion each week during the team meeting.  
- Communicating my updates and progress clearly in our group chat.  
- Asking at the end of each week whether my explanations were clear enough, so I can get feedback.  

**SMART Goal:**  
By the end of this sprint, I want to have actively shared my ideas at least four times in team meetings and received feedback confirming that my communication has become clearer.

### Reflectie Davinio

In sprint 2 ive been busy working on a lot of technical aspects of the project, but i have definitely gotten allot of feedback on my workprocess in the team that i didn't pay enough attention to this sprint. 


### Reflectie op vorige feedback
    

#### Feedback

#### Tip
    Give the team updates on your progress more frequently.

#### Top
    You often take the reins.
 

This feeback also reflect what ive noticed myself. When it comes to teamwork, i often take the lead and initiative to help the team progress. On the otherhand i dont often enough give updates on how far along i am, resulting in the team being unaware of what ive done.
