### Sprint Reflection – Zarko

During this sprint, I received positive feedback that I was very motivating and brought a lot of energy to the team. I’m glad that my enthusiasm helped to keep team morale high and encouraged collaboration. I believe maintaining a positive attitude within the group is one of my strengths, as it helps us stay productive and engaged, especially when facing challenges.  

However, one point for improvement was that I should stick to the planning more closely to prevent potential issues. I noticed that sometimes I focused too much on helping others or working on multiple tasks at once, which made it harder to follow the original plan strictly. This occasionally led to minor delays or last-minute adjustments.  

To improve this, I’ve created the following **SMART goal** for the next sprint:  

> **I want to stick to my planning more consistently by reviewing and updating my tasks during every stand-up meeting, so that I stay on track with deadlines and avoid last-minute issues. I will evaluate my progress in each stand-up by checking whether I’m up to date with my planned tasks.**

By doing this, I aim to maintain my motivating presence in the team while becoming more structured and reliable in my task management. Regularly reflecting on my progress during stand-ups will help me stay organized and ensure that my positive energy also contributes to better planning and smoother teamwork.
